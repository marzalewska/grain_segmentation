# grain_segmentation
The aim of the project is to analyse (detect) selected rock elements using MatLAB and calculate the surface area of the individual components. 

A polarising microscope was used to take close-up photographs of the sandstone rock cuts.

Images were taken with a rotation every 30◦. Due to the properties of the quartz, it should change colour, from white to black, in the test samples as it is rotated. Images were taken with a rotation every 30◦. The following information was used to perform the segmentation: 
- Due to the properties of quartz, it should change colour, from white to black, in the test samples with the rotation of the microscope stool.
- With a single polariser, the quartz grains are clearly visible as green grains, with the crossed ones as spots of different shades of green.
- With two crossed polarisers, the calcite takes on a yellow/orange colour and its structure is granular.

After all the transformations, the final result is the image below, in which the green colour represents glauconite grains, red stands for quartz, blue for calcite and yellow represents other types of grains.
